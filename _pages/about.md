I am currently a PhD student at [Kyungpook National University](https://en.knu.ac.kr) advised by [Dr. Jae-Mo Kang](https://sites.google.com/site/knuaislab/professor) [Computer Vision & Learning Theory LAB](https://sites.google.com/view/jmkang)
<br><br>

My primary research interests are deep learning, federated learning and computer vision. My current research work focuses on federated learning and its application in wireless IoT settings.
<br><br>
I graduated from [Kyungpook National University](https://en.knu.ac.kr) with a Master's in Artificial Intelligence. My thesis was was on Hierarchical Federated Learning in IoT networks.
